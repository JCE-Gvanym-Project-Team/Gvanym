# Intrution to our proect
The project focuses on recruitment management for the "Gvanim" association. "Gvanim" is an association that employs social workers, volunteers, and caregivers for people with physical disabilities or people on the autism spectrum.

The association has encountered difficulties managing recruitment processes in society, and all management has been done so far through Excel, which has created significant difficulties in management.

We were asked to create a website that would manage the recruitment system. Recruiters will be able to upload job openings, candidates will upload their resumes, and the recruiter from their interface will be able to easily view submissions. Each candidate will have a profile where recruiters can keep notes, interview summaries, send generic emails, and keep the candidate's details for future reference.
